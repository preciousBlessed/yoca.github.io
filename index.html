            camp. It is an exercise in which motivational topics are presented
            to them to uplift the Corps Members spirit, enhance them morally and
            instill in them a sense of patriotism. In Yobe State, the ten
            platoons are named after the core values of the scheme:

              Punctuality, Patriotism, Dedication, Discipline and Diligence </strong
            >. Corps Members use the core values as meditation topics to be
            presented on platoon basis. This is to instill in them the core
            values of NYSC Scheme. Morning meditation takes place every morning
            except on Sundays.
